/**
 * Since the Java launcher checks if the main class extends javafx.application.Application,
 * and in that case it requires the JavaFX runtime available as modules (not as jars), a
 * possible workaround to make it work, should be adding a new Main class that will be the
 * main class of your project, and that class will be the one that calls your JavaFX
 * Application class.
