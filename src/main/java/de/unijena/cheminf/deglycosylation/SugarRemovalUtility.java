     * Removes circular and linear sugar moieties from the given atom container and returns the resulting aglycon (at list index 0)
     * and the removed sugar moieties. Which substructures are removed depends on the
     * settings for circular and linear sugar detection, the setting specifying whether only terminal sugar moieties should be
     * removed and on the set preservation mode.
     * <br>If only terminal sugar moieties are to be removed, the detected sugars are one-by-one tested for
     * whether they are terminal or not and removed if they are. The iteration starts anew after iterating over all
     * candidates and stops if no terminal sugar was removed in one whole iteration. Important note: To ensure the removal
     * also of linear sugars that only become terminal after removing one or more terminal circular sugar and
     * vice-versa, multiple iterations of circular and linear sugar detection and removal are done here. Therefore, this
     * method might in special cases return another aglycon (the 'true' aglycon) than e.g. a subsequent call to the methods
     * for separate circular and linear sugar removal.
     * <br>If only terminal sugar moieties are
     * removed from the molecule, any disconnected structure resulting from a removal step must be too small to
     * keep according to the preservation mode option and the set threshold and is cleared away.
     * <br>If all the circular and linear sugars are to be removed from the query molecule (including non-terminal
     * ones), those disconnected structures that are too small are only cleared once at the end of the routine.
     * <br>In the latter case, the deglycosylated molecule (aglycon at list index 0) may consist of two or more
     * disconnected structures when
     * returned, whereas in the former case, the returned structure always consists of one connected structure.
     * <br>If the given molecule consists only of sugars, an empty atom container is returned at list index 0.
     * <br>The returned sugar moieties that were removed from the molecule have invalid valences at atoms formerly
     * bonded to the molecule core or to other sugar moieties while all valences on the aglycon at position 0 are saturated.
     * <br>Spiro atoms connecting a removed circular sugar moiety to another cycle are preserved (if labelled by the
     * respective property).
     * <br>If the respective option is set, a property will be added to the given atom container at list index 0
     * specifying whether it contains (or contained before removal) circular/linear/any kind of sugar moieties or not.
