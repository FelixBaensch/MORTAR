## Description
MORTAR ('MOlecule fRagmenTation fRamework') is an open software project that supports workflows of
molecular fragmentation and substructure analysis. The Java/JavaFX rich-client application offers extensive graphical 
functions for visualising the fragmentation results of individual compounds or entire compound sets. With several 
views and analysis functions, MORTAR supports the interpretation of fragmentation results. In addition to three 
currently integrated methods for fragmentation and substructure analysis - 
<a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder">ErtlFunctionalGroupsFinder</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/JonasSchaub/SugarRemoval">Sugar Removal Utility</a>, 
and <a href="https://github.com/cdk/cdk-scaffold">CDK-Scaffold</a> - MORTAR allows straightforward integration of 
additional fragmentation algorithms with automatic generation of settings 
menus. All cheminformatics functionalities are implemented based on the <a href="https://github.com/cdk/cdk">Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)</a>.<br>
The scientific article describing MORTAR can be found here: 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-022-00674-9"> MORTAR: a rich client application for in silico molecule fragmentation (Baensch et al. 2023) </a>

## Installation
### Application
Pre-compiled and executable MORTAR distributions can be found attached to the 
<a href="https://github.com/FelixBaensch/MORTAR/releases">marked releases</a>.

<p>
<b>Windows:</b> A convenient Windows OS installer executable for MORTAR is available 
(click <a href="https://github.com/FelixBaensch/MORTAR/releases/download/v1.2.0.0-beta/MORTAR_v1.2.0.0-beta_WINx64_installer.exe">here</a> to 
automatically download the installer .exe of the latest version). Download the installer 
executable, start, and follow the instructions to install MORTAR. Note that the installation includes a full 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE). After installation, create a shortcut to an appropriate MORTAR start batch file on your 
Windows desktop. E.g. for MORTAR to use up to 4 gigabyte of RAM, copy a shortcut to batch file "MORTAR.bat" which is 
located in the MORTAR program folder (default "C:\Program Files\MORTAR\MORTARv1.2.0.0-beta\bin" or the path specified at 
installation). To start MORTAR, double-click the created shortcut. MORTAR can be uninstalled by the provided 
Uninstall.exe executable in the MORTAR program folder or standard Windows functions.
<br>
As an alternative to "MORTAR.bat", there is also the "MORTAR_20GB.bat" batch file available that allocates up to 
20 GB of RAM for MORTAR. If you want to configure your own heap space settings, open one of the provided batch files 
and adjust the line
</p>

<p>
```shell
set DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS="-Xms4g" "-Xmx4g"
```
</p>

with your chosen initially allocated memory (-Xms) and maximum value (-Xmx) accordingly.<br>

<p>Should this installation or the execution of the batch files not work for you, try the guidelines for Linux and MaxOS 
described below. As an alternative way, they should also work on Windows.
</p>

<p><b>Linux and macOS:</b> Every release has the executable Java ARchive (JAR) "MORTAR-fat-1.2.0.0-beta.jar"
attached, which contains the packaged MORTAR code together with all dependencies 
(click <a href="https://github.com/FelixBaensch/MORTAR/releases/download/v1.2.0.0-beta/MORTAR-fat-1.2.0.0-beta.jar">here</a> to 
automatically download the JAR of the latest version). 
To run MORTAR (with up to 4 GB of RAM available, e.g.), 
execute the JAR from the command-line using</p>

<p>
```shell
java -jar -Xms512m -Xmx4g [path to]MORTAR-fat-1.2.0.0-beta.jar
```
</p>

A JDK or JRE of version 21.0.1 or higher needs to be installed on your system and linked to the "java" command. 
Otherwise, replace "java" with the path to the java command of your JDK or JRE.<br>

<p>Please note that MORTAR only supports x64 (on all three platforms) and AArch64 (on macOS and Linux) architectures in general. 
For the latter, a special "fat JAR" named "MORTAR-fat-aarch64-1.2.0.0-beta.jar" is available from the distributions attached to the releases and must be used 
(click <a href="https://github.com/FelixBaensch/MORTAR/releases/download/v1.2.0.0-beta/MORTAR-fat-aarch64-1.2.0.0-beta.jar">here</a> to 
automatically download the AArch64 JAR of the latest version).</p>
Also note that using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is not recommended, since a lot of additional configurations 
have to be made there to run Java GUI applications.

### Source code
This is a Gradle project. In order to use the source code for your own software or do your own MORTAR build, download or 
clone the repository and open it in a Gradle-supporting IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) as a Gradle project and execute the 
build.gradle file. Gradle will then take care of installing all dependencies. A Java Development Kit (JDK) of version 21.0.1 
or higher must also be pre-installed and set as project JDK / project compiler.
The Gradle build process is configured to include a specific Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in the "install" folder.
For this to work, you need to create an "AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-21.0.1_12_jre\" folder and put the JRE with the specified version 
into it (i.e. sub-folders of "AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-21.0.1_12_jre\" need to be "bin", "conf", "legal", "lib", etc.).
